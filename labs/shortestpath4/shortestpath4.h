 * all other nodes, it does this by checking if the current path is
 * shortest or a path through a node k is shorter (It checks all
 * k). If a node is in a neg cycle can be checked to see if the cost
 * to go from from a node k to itself is negative; and if we kan
 * create a path from i -> k -> j then that cost is also -inf as it
 * can reach the negative cycle.
 *
 * Input :
 * - graph: The current graph.
 *
 * Output:
 * - result: vector vector with distance for all paths between nodes
 *
 * TC: O(|Nodes|^3)
